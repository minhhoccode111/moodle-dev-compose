## moodle-dev-compose

This project is an alternative way to setup Moodle dev environment using Docker. It is close to LAMP approach from configuring perspective - there is only one database server for all instances of Moodle, and instead of several Apache VirtualHost sites, separate webserver container is used for each Moodle instance. This results in having clean host system (no direct installation of service packages) and provides flexibility to mix versions of PHP for different Moodle instances, as well as easily add other services, such as Memcached or SAML.

This setup can co-exist on the same host with [moodle-docker](https://github.com/moodlehq/moodle-docker), which is strongly advised to use for running tests.

## Features

- Different virtual hostnames (or virtual paths) for each instance of Moodle.
- Uses `moodlehq/moodle-php-apache` Moodle HQ maintained images.
- Shared DB server for all Moodle instances with Phpmyadmin (or Adminer) web UI.
- Mail server container with web UI.
- Easy to extend, enable SSL, add other any other services (see [examples](#other-services)).

## Requirements

You will need:

- [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/). If you don't need GUI, installing only [Docker engine](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/) is sufficient, but you need [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/) installed separately.
- Clone of Moodle repo that you want to work on.
- Make sure you don't run local webserver that is using port 80 (if you need,
  change it to different port or use different port in compose file).
- Make sure you don't run local mysql/mariadb server that is using port 3306 (if
  you need, change it to different port or use different port in compose file)

### Moodle config.php

Your Moodle config.php should contain (as minimum):

```
<?php  // Moodle configuration file

unset($CFG);
global $CFG;
$CFG = new stdClass();

$CFG->dbtype    = 'mariadb';
$CFG->dblibrary = 'native';
$CFG->dbhost    = 'mariadb';
$CFG->dbname    = 'moodle-main';
$CFG->dbuser    = 'moodle';
$CFG->dbpass    = 'moodle';
$CFG->prefix    = 'mdl_';
$CFG->dboptions = array (
  'dbpersist' => 0,
  'dbport' => '',
  'dbsocket' => '',
  'dbcollation' => 'utf8mb4_general_ci',
);

$CFG->wwwroot   = 'http://moodle.local';
$CFG->dataroot  = '/var/www/moodledata';
$CFG->admin     = 'admin';

$CFG->directorypermissions = 0777;

require_once(__DIR__ . '/lib/setup.php');
```

You may add subdirectory to `dataroot` if you wish, e.g. for using different
dir for different databases when you switch between Moodle versions.

### Hostname

Compose file is defining proxy container that handles hostname mapping to web
container, this makes things simpler as you may add more web containers (e.g.
for different repos, php versions or DBs) using a different hostname for each.

By default, the only web container is called `moodle.local`.

To make possible accessing container from your host machine by using
hostname, you need a record in your `/etc/hosts` file pointing to localhost.

```
127.0.0.1 moodle.local
```

## Running environment

Define env variable with location to your Moodle code:

```bash
export MOODLE_DOCKER_WWWROOT=/home/ruslan/git/moodle
```

This env var is used for Moodle codebase mount inside the web container.

Define env variable with PHP version to be used:

```bash
export MOODLE_DOCKER_PHP_VERSION=8.1
```

This is used to select `moodlehq/moodle-php-apache` image version to use.

To start the environment, use `docker compose` command. You need to execute it
from this repo directory:

```bash
> docker compose up
```

You can keep the terminal open to see the log, alernatively you may run it in
deaemon mode:

```bash
> docker compose up -d
```

You can see the status of containers using:

```bash
> docker compose ps
```

Above command amond other things is showing ports mapping from local interface to containers.

Notice that names of containers specified in compose file are resolved to
their IPs on any container in the set, e.g. you may use `mariadb` in your
moodle `config.php` as DB hostname.

You may stop the containers using `docker compose stop` or destroy them using
`docker compose down`(or `docker compose down -v` to also remove volumes). It
is safe to desroy as you are using volumes, so next time you start them, all
data will be in place within newly created containers.

### Accessing Moodle

Now when you have database created and config.php configured, you may enter
`http://moodle.local` in your browser on host machine. This will point to your
localhost according to `/etc/hosts` record we created, which will then be
handled by `nginx-proxy` container (notice the port mapping mentioned above).
`nginx-proxy` will recognise hostname `moodle.local` and redirect request to
`moodle-dev-compose-moodle-1` container that will show you Moodle setup screen
in the browser.

If you need `php` command line (e.g. for setting up Moodle or cron run), you
may access it from web container:

```bash
> docker exec -it -u www-data moodle-dev-compose-moodle-1 bash
www-data@0c46f3f2037a:~/html$
www-data@1d18bc646bf4:~/html$ php admin/cli/upgrade.php
No upgrade needed for the installed version 4.4dev (Build: 20240215) (2024021500). Thanks for coming anyway!
```

### Database

#### MariaDB

By default MariaDB docker image is used. The data is located on
the volume, so recreating container will not cause data loss.

On the first run, you will probably need to create database that you will use.
You can do that using phpmyadmin included in compose service file, and accessible at
`http://moodle.local:8081` (use user `root` and password `root` for admin
access). User `moodle` with password `moodle` is pre-created (we use it in
moodle config.php).

Accessing server using DB client is also possible on `localhost:3306`, as container
propagates this port to the host machine. Alternatively, you can access it by
executing shell on running DB container and using `mysql` client:

```bash
> docker exec -u mysql -it moodle-dev-compose-mariadb-1 bash
mysql@35e794676852:/$ mysql -u root -p
Enter password:
Welcome to the MariaDB monitor.  Commands end with ; or \g.
Your MariaDB connection id is 5
Server version: 10.6.16-MariaDB-1:10.6.16+maria~ubu2004 mariadb.org binary distribution

Copyright (c) 2000, 2018, Oracle, MariaDB Corporation Ab and others.

Type 'help;' or '\h' for help. Type '\c' to clear the current input statement.

MariaDB [(none)]>
```

```bash
CREATE DATABASE `moodle-main` DEFAULT CHARACTER SET utf8mb4 COLLATE utf8mb4_unicode_ci;
CREATE USER 'moodle'@'%' IDENTIFIED BY 'your_secure_password';
GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON `moodle-main`.* TO 'moodle'@'%';
FLUSH PRIVILEGES;
```

#### Postgres

If you prefer Postgres, modify `include` section at the top of `compose.yaml`.

```
include:
#  - mariadb.service.yaml
  - postgres.service.yaml
```

For postgres service offical Postgres 13 docker image is used. The data is located on
the volume, so recreating container will not cause data loss.

On the first run, you will probably need to create database and user that you will use.
You can do that using adminer included in compose service file, and accessible at
`http://moodle.local:8082` (use user `postgres` and password `postgres` for
admin access).

Accessing server using DB client is possible on `localhost:5432`, as container
propagates this port to the host machine. Alternatively, you can access it by
executing shell on running DB container and using `psql` client:

```bash
> docker exec -it -u postgres moodle-dev-compose-postgres-1 bash
postgres@6f001003d4c4:/$ createuser -DPRS moodle
Enter password for new role:
Enter it again:
postgres@6f001003d4c4:/$ createdb -O moodle -E UTF-8 moodle-main
postgres@6f001003d4c4:/$ psql

postgres=# \l
                                         List of databases
           Name            |  Owner   | Encoding |  Collate   |   Ctype    |   Access privileges
---------------------------+----------+----------+------------+------------+-----------------------
 moodle-main               | moodlepg | UTF8     | en_US.utf8 | en_US.utf8 |
 postgres                  | postgres | UTF8     | en_US.utf8 | en_US.utf8 |
 template0                 | postgres | UTF8     | en_US.utf8 | en_US.utf8 | =c/postgres          +
                           |          |          |            |            | postgres=CTc/postgres
 template1                 | postgres | UTF8     | en_US.utf8 | en_US.utf8 | =c/postgres          +
                           |          |          |            |            | postgres=CTc/postgres
(4 rows)

postgres=#

```

Moodle `config.php` would need changes:

```
$CFG->dbtype    = 'pgsql';
$CFG->dbhost    = 'postgres';
```

##### Upgrading Postgres to next major version

I suggest to use https://github.com/tianon/docker-postgres-upgrade image to
perform major release upgrade. For 12 to 13 upgrade I createed a new volume
called `pgdata13`, then stop database gracefully by logging in into container
and executing:

```
docker exec -it -u postgres moodle-dev-compose-postgres-1 bash
postgres@ea13edb262fb:/$ pg_ctl stop
```

Now, when service is gracefully stopped, execute:

```
docker run --rm -v pgdata12:/var/lib/postgresql/12/data -v pgdata13:/var/lib/postgresql/13/data tianon/postgres-upgrade:12-to-13
```

This will perform upgrade. Finally, shut down your dev suit, make necessary changes in
compose files and start again.

### Receiving mail

We start Mailpit container by default that allows to receive email and provides
interface to view it.

In Moodle configuration file add:

```
$CFG->smtphosts = 'mail:1025'
```

Web interface to view emails is available at `http://moodle.local:8025`

## Adding PHP extensions

### Profiling

You can add Xhprof extension and use Moodle built-in profiling tool.

```bash
> docker exec -it moodle-dev-compose-moodle-1 bash
root@62ba9a041e0f:/var/www/html#  pecl install xhprof
WARNING: channel "pecl.php.net" has updated its protocols, use "pecl channel-update pecl.php.net" to update
downloading xhprof-2.2.0.tgz ...
...
root@62ba9a041e0f:/var/www/html# docker-php-ext-enable xhprof
root@62ba9a041e0f:/var/www/html# php -i | grep xhprof
/usr/local/etc/php/conf.d/docker-php-ext-xhprof.ini,
xhprof
xhprof support => enabled
xhprof.collect_additional_info => 0 => 0
xhprof.output_dir => no value => no value
xhprof.sampling_depth => 0x7fffffff => 0x7fffffff
xhprof.sampling_interval => 100000 => 100000
```

Xhprof extension has been installed and enabled, restart the web container.

```bash
> docker restart moodle-dev-compose-moodle-1
```

A this point you can navigate to Site administration > Development >
Profiling, enable it and trigger for the content you need to profile.

Notice, if you destroy container, you will need to repeat above steps on the
new one.

## More containers

Suppose you need another container with a different php version, but for the
same Moodle instance. You can easily add another container either directly to
existing compose file, or by using a seaparate file:

Create a new file called `compose.local.yaml` containing:

```
services:
    moodle83:
        image: moodlehq/moodle-php-apache:8.3
        volumes:
          - moodledata:/var/www/moodledata
          - $MOODLE_DOCKER_WWWROOT:/var/www/html
        depends_on:
          - mariadb
        environment:
          - VIRTUAL_HOST=moodle83.local
        networks:
          - devbox
```

Now, stop the existing containers and modify `compose.yaml`, to [`include`](https://docs.docker.com/compose/multiple-compose-files/include/) `compose.local.yaml`:

```
include:
  - mariadb.service.yaml
#  - postgres.service.yaml
  - compose.local.yaml
```

This will bring a new container into play on the next `docker compose up` run.

Note: if you prefer not to use `include` section in `compose.yaml`, alternative way to use many config
files is:

```bash
> docker compose -f compose.yaml -f compose.local.yaml up
```

Add the new host to your `/etc/hosts` and you can start using it on `http://moodle83.local`.

```
127.0.0.1 moodle.local moodle83.local
```

## Using SSL

If you need access by `https`, create self-signed certificates named
`localhost`:

```
$ mkdir certs
$ openssl req -x509 -nodes -newkey rsa:2048 -keyout certs/localhost.key -out certs/localhost.crt
```

Then use them as part of nginx-proxy configuration:

```
diff --git a/compose.yaml b/compose.yaml
index 0bc7fb0..934cc58 100644
--- a/compose.yaml
+++ b/compose.yaml
@@ -5,9 +5,11 @@ services:
         container_name: nginx-proxy
         ports:
           - "80:80"
+          - "443:443"
         volumes:
           - /var/run/docker.sock:/tmp/docker.sock:ro
           - ./nginx_proxy.conf:/etc/nginx/conf.d/nginx_proxy.conf:ro
+          - ./certs:/etc/nginx/certs
         networks:
           - devbox
     moodle:
```

and in the service that you need to make accesible over `https`, add `CERT_NAME` env var:

```
           - mariadb
         environment:
           - VIRTUAL_HOST=moodle.local
+          - CERT_NAME=localhost
         networks:
           - devbox
```

Also in Moodle config make sure `wwwroot` reflects correct protocol:

```
$CFG->wwwroot   = 'https://moodle.local';
$CFG->sslproxy  = true;
```

## Other services

Using docker you can add any service you need. Examples below assume you are
adding configuration to `compose.local.yaml`.

### Memcached

Adding memcached will make your instance running faster.

Your `compose.local.yaml` should contain:

```
services:
    memcached0:
        image: memcached:1.4.33
        networks:
          - devbox
```

In Moodle, navigate to cache configuration and create instance using
`memcached0` as hostname and `11211` as port.

### SAML2

In order to deploy SAML2 IdP, we will be using [kristophjunge/docker-test-saml-idp](https://github.com/kristophjunge/docker-test-saml-idp) docker image.

You need [auth_saml2](https://github.com/catalyst/moodle-auth_saml2) plugin to be installed in Moodle, it will act as SAML2 service provider (SP).

Your `compose.local.yaml` should contain:

```
services:
    samlidp:
        image: kristophjunge/test-saml-idp
        environment:
          VIRTUAL_HOST: samlidp.local
          SIMPLESAMLPHP_SP_ENTITY_ID: http://moodle.local/auth/saml2/sp/metadata.php
          SIMPLESAMLPHP_SP_ASSERTION_CONSUMER_SERVICE: http://moodle.local/auth/saml2/sp/saml2-acs.php/moodle.local
          SIMPLESAMLPHP_SP_SINGLE_LOGOUT_SERVICE: http://moodle.local/auth/saml2/sp/saml2-logout.php/moodle.local
          SIMPLESAMLPHP_ADMIN_PASSWORD: admin1
          SIMPLESAMLPHP_SECRET_SALT: salt
        ports:
        - "8080:8080"
        - "8443:8443"
        volumes:
        - ./saml2/authsources.php:/var/www/simplesamlphp/config/authsources.php
        networks:
          devbox:
            aliases:
              - samlidp.local
```

Those `SIMPLESAMLPHP_SP_*` values can be identified from SP metadata output (`http://moodle.local/auth/saml2/sp/metadata.php`).

You also need `saml2/authsources.php` containing user accounts, which is mounted
in container, use example below as starting point:

```
<?php

$config = [

    'admin' => [
        'core:AdminPassword',
    ],

    'example-userpass' => [
        'exampleauth:UserPass',
        'samlu1:samlu1pass' => [
            'uid' => ['samlu1'],
            'eduPersonAffiliation' => ['group1'],
            'email' => 'samluser1@example.com',
            'firstName' => 'Saml',
            'lastName' => 'User 1',
            'customOrg' => 'Company 1',
        ],
        'samlu2:samlu2pass' => [
            'uid' => ['samlu2'],
            'eduPersonAffiliation' => ['group2'],
            'email' => 'samluser2@example.com',
            'firstName' => 'Saml',
            'lastName' => 'User 2',
            'customOrg' => 'Company 2',
        ],
    ],
];
```

When you start containers, navigate to
`http://samlidp.local:8080/simplesaml/module.php/core/frontpage_federation.php`,
you will find metadata link you can use in `auth_saml2` `idpmetadata` setting
to complete setup (or you can use metadata XML that you can retrieve on the
same page).

If you get `Invalid metadata at
http://samlidp.local:8080/simplesaml/saml2/idp/metadata.php` error, most
likely CURL security settings do not permit URL access, check
`curlsecurityblockedhosts` and `curlsecurityallowedport` config settings in
Moodle. If you get `Setting secure cookie on plain http is not allowed`, untick `cookiesecure` in Moodle settings.

Once configured (you need to add field mapping as well, for example snippet
above you may need to map `firstName`, `lastName` and `email`), you should be
able to login to Moodle using one of accounts defined in `authsources.php`.
